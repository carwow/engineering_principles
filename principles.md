# Introduction

__History__

We made our first attempt at formalising and defining the carwow engineering principles in January 2019. To compile the first draft, we asked all engineers that had been at carwow for at least 2 years to try and capture the engineering culture that had contributed to our success. 

__Contributing__

To be true to our values of self-improvement our principles should and will evolve over time. We've decided to write them down so that the process of changing them is tracked, and clear to everybody.
If you wish to add something to the principles, or modify some of the existing principles please **open a pull request.**
We'd like to see at least 10 people agreeing to a change before merging into master, so please contribute to PR discussions. 

David Santoro (Co-Founder/CTO) will be the one merging any changes, for now.

__How to use the principles__

In engineering there are many correct ways of doing things, to avoid unnecessary debates when possible we'd like to pick solutions that conforms to this principles. You can use this principles as guidance, or you can refer to them when giving feedback on someone else behaviour or work.
They will also be used when interviewing, and shown to potential candidates so they can figure out if carwow is the right place for them

# The carwow Engineering Principles


__Build what matters__ 
  
    * Engineering effort is a scarce commodity. It should only be applied to problems that “move the needle” for the company
    * The biggest achievement of an Engineer at carwow is to provide positive business impact with no line of code written (maybe even removing some)
    * We don't manage our own server, or have a self hosted continuous integration software.
    
    
__Do *big* things in small steps__
  
    * Breaking down big features in small steps doesn’t mean we work only on small incremental improvement. A longer term vision or objective is our north star.
    
    
__Strive for fast feedback loops__
  
    * We use several practices to achieve the above like TDD, code reviews, continuous delivery, vertical slicing, AB tests, and customer feedback.
    
    
__Investigate, Implement ,Iterate__
  
    * We always question and challenge the value of work instead of following blindly; and then we commit to delivering early and often.
    

__Simple and clear Engineering__
  
    * We value simple and clear solutions that solve problems without unnecessary complexity. At the same time we keep the long term vision in mind and don’t just build for today. 
    

__Outside in ownership__
  
    * We value shipping early and observing in production; we are fearless. We believe a developer is responsible for owning their work all the way through to delivering value, including monitoring and performance. 

__Sustainable pace__
  
    * Panic and rushing leads to bad decisions, we believe in aggressive scoping appropriately and focussing on value. It leads to better results; with a happier and healthier team. 
    
    
__We strive to be informed by data as much as possible__
    
    * Whenever taking a decision try to gather some quantitative data. If quant is not available use qualitative data. If you fail at those two, only then use your guts and experience.
    

__Collaborate!__

    * Product development is a team effort, we give each other feedback early and often, always respectfully
    * Example: If you touch a new area of the codebase, ask for help 
    * Example: When a feature is too complicated, pair
    * Example: Don’t get stuck for too long, ask for help.

  
__Evolutionary Architecture__
  
    * We evolve our architecture and technology constantly as our business evolves. We experiment with new technologies at the edges of our systems and adopt carefully and for real business value.
    * Example: elm 
    * Example: single page css
    * Example: some architecture decisions 
    

__Continuous Improvement__
  
    * We leave code better than we found it. We refactor before developing a feature, to ease its development. 
  Example: 
  

__Reduce code and people dependencies__
  
    * We practice shared code and project ownership. Any team member should be able to work on any project interchangeably and we aim to rotate teams to ensure people have exposure to all parts of the codebase.



__Healthy conflict__
  
    * We believe in a blameless culture; which includes holding each other accountable through respectful feedback
